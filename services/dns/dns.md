## What is DNS? 

### This is what the internet says: 
```
Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This is necessary because, although domain names are easy for people to remember, computers or machines, access websites based on IP addresses.
```

### The Nitty Gritty:

- DNS uses port 53 [Common TCP/UDP port list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)
- [DNS wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_server_software) Really says it all without having to rewrite it here.
- Think Authorative Server (master) and Recursive Server (dns caches)


### Configuration:

- (Add config notes from example, see other github doc)
